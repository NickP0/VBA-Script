# Visual-Basic-for-Applications
# I have written a script that can be used for importing and manipulating .csv files into separate, relevant categories (subtotals). 
# This script also recognises any changes made on pivot tables and its datasource as an 'event change' and will update automatically. 
# I have left worksheet names as <blank>/<raw_blank> - please amend as needed. 

# PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS HAS BEEN WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR IMPORTING AND MANIPULATING .CSV's FROM RAMP
# AMEND ACCORDINGLY!
