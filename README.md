# Import, Manipulate Data and Updating Pivot Tables
**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS HAS BEEN WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY FOR IMPORTING AND MANIPULATING .CSV's FROM RAMP**<br>
*Feel free to make any changes that suit your needs*<br>
- I have written a script that can be used for importing and manipulating .csv files into separate, relevant categories (subtotals). 
- This script also recognises any changes made on pivot tables and its datasource as an 'event change' and will update automatically. 
- I have left worksheet names as empty strings; "" - please amend as needed.
